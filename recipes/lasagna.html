    These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade
    lasagna recipe:<br />

    · <strong>Meat</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground
    meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).<br />
    · <strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the
    ground meat.<br />
    · <strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a
    can of crushed tomatoes.<br />
    · <strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of
    parsley and crush one clove of garlic.<br />
    · <strong>Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity
    from the tomatoes.<br />
    · <strong>Spices and seasonings: </strong>This homemade lasagna is seasoned
    with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.<br />
    · <strong>Noodles: </strong>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This
    recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to
    save time.<br />
    · <strong>Cheese:</strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and
    Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.<br />
    · <strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they
    act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).<br />
