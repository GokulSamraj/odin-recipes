    <h1>Roast Spatchcock Turkey</h1>
    <p>This spatchcock turkey is juicy, flavorful, and perfectly cooked in a fraction of the time of a traditional whole turkey. By removing the backbone and flattening the bird, you’ll shorten the cooking time, ensure even roasting and crispy skin, and make carving a breeze. Once you try it, you may never go back to roasting the old way!</p>
    <p>Never made a spatchcocked turkey for Thanksgiving? This is your year. Spatchcocking a turkey results in a wonderfully juicy and evenly cooked bird in a fraction of the time.</p>
